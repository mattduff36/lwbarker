This is a placeholder for the favicon.ico file.

Please create a multi-size ICO file for the website favicon and save it as "favicon.ico" in this directory.

The favicon should:
- Include multiple sizes: 16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixels
- Format: ICO file format
- Content: L.W. Barker Transport logo or initials
- Colors: Use the brand colors (#1a56db blue and/or orange accent)

This icon will be used as the website favicon in browser tabs and bookmarks. You can use the favicon.svg file as a reference for the design.

You can create an ICO file using online converters or image editing software that supports the ICO format.
